<strong>Cataracts</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
A
cataract is the opacification of the crystalline lens, which is the
lens located inside the eye.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Surgical
    treatment of cataracts</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
treatment consists of surgically removing the opaque lens and
implanting an artificial lens.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Treatment
    objective</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
purpose of surgery is to treat the eye disease known as cataracts and
consists of the removal from inside the eye of the lens that has
become opaque and causes reduced vision. The removal of the
crystalline lens causes a large visual defect, which is compensated
for with the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens. Thanks
to the removal of the crystalline lens</p>

natural
opaque and the implantation of the artificial intraocular lens - if
no adverse events occur - an improvement in vision is also possible
in the presence of other eye diseases even if visual recovery
comparable to that of a healthy eye cannot be expected. Some of these
may require specific treatment before, during or after cataract
surgery.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alternative
    treatments and consequences of non or delayed intervention</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
operation is necessary because there are no therapies that can cure
cataracts, and failure to operate results in almost total loss of
sight within a time frame that varies from person to person. Delayed
intervention makes surgery more risky.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Surgery</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
operation is performed in the operating theatre with the aid of an
operating microscope. It is a major surgical act since the eye has to
be incised and one of its internal elements - the crystalline lens -
has to be extracted.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis and
hospitalisation is not necessary. After the operation, a short rest
period is advisable, which will be suggested by your ophthalmologist
together with the anaesthetist.</p>
<p>
<u>Anaesthesia:
</u>the
eye can be rendered numb with the instillation of drops alone or
alternatively with injections close to the eye; only in rare cases
may general anaesthesia be necessary. The choice is made by the eye
surgeon with the advice of the anaesthetist on the basis of the
patient's clinical condition. The patient's wishes will also be taken
into account as far as possible. Local anaesthesia does not prevent
eye movements by the patient.
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<u>Surgery
    technique: </u>cataract
removal, in most cases, is performed with a probe that crushes and
sucks out the crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is contained in
an envelope called a capsule. The capsule is 4 micrometres thick (a
hair is 80 micrometres thick) and is extremely fragile. The capsule
must be left in place because it serves as a support for the
artificial lens and because it keeps the posterior portion of the eye
(vitreous and retina) separate from the anterior portion.

Cataract
removal is followed by the implantation of an artificial lens. The
eye incision may or may not be sutured.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Choice
    of artificial lens</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
artificial lens is chosen to allow distance or near vision, it cannot
correct both and it cannot correct astigmatism.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Under
certain special conditions, the artificial lens is visible from the
outside as it reflects the light incident on the eye.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Rarely,
the artificial lens may experience changes in transparency that can
cause visual disturbances and reduced vision.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
However,
there are also other types of artificial lens that allow both
distance and near vision. Still others permit the correction of
astigmatism. It will be up to the surgeon to determine the most
appropriate type of artificial lens for you, knowing that some
options cannot be paid for by the National Health Service.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
If
you choose the implantation of an artificial lens capable of both
distance and near vision (multifocal IOL), you need to know that</p>
<p>
-
it will certainly not be possible to do without glasses, especially
for close-up</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
near focus can only be good at a distance of 35 to 40 cm</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
outside this distance the focus may not be optimal</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
visual capacity may change depending on lighting conditions</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
various and very subjective visual disturbances may appear in the
postoperative period, which usually diminish over time</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
a capsulotomy may be useful to reduce visual disturbances</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
if visual disturbances do not diminish even after capsulotomy, it may
be necessary to replace</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
the
multifocal IOL with a standard monofocal distance or near IOL.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
If
you choose the implantation of an artificial lens that corrects
astigmatism, you should know that:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
a certain degree of astigmatism may still remain, however, so that
after the operation it will still be necessary to use distance
glasses</p>

Another operation may be necessary to reposition the artificial lens,
since in the hours following surgery the artificial lens may rotate
and position itself on a different axis from the one on which it was
placed by the surgeon during surgery.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
There
are special implantable optical systems such as artificial
crystalline lenses that can help improve vision in individuals with
low vision due to other serious eye diseases. If you opt for the use
of an implantable optical system in a visually impaired person, you
need to be aware that:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
visual improvement cannot be guaranteed as it will depend on the
functional status of the other eye structures</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
eyesight will necessarily be different from before the operation and
will require training and rehabilitation.</p>

    <p>
        It
        is important to remember, however, that cataract surgery is not a
        refractive operation (refractive operations are those electively
        indicated for the correction of visual defects). Therefore, a visual
        defect (myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism) may remain after the
        operation due to scarring abnormalities and the intrinsic
        limitations of artificial lens measurement and calculation
        techniques. This residual defect can be suitably corrected using (in
        most cases) spectacles. When this is not possible or when the
        patient requests it, further correction can be carried out using the
        ECCIMERI LASER. This procedure is not part of cataract surgery and
        is not dispensed by the National Health Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>In
    his specific case, the power of the artificial lens was chosen to
    harmonise the refractive characteristics of his eye as much as
    possible with his visual expectations. Therefore, an attempt will be
    made to obtain a refractive result as close as possible to
    __________________________.</strong>

<p>
<strong>Postoperative
    course</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Before
leaving the surgical centre, the patient receives a sheet in which
both the postoperative instructions and the medication to be used are
indicated. The patient must start treatment within a few hours after
surgery. The patient must never discontinue treatment (eye drops or
pills) on his or her own initiative. Prescribed medication serves for
healing and to prevent complications. If there is any doubt about the
postoperative course, the patient should contact one of the members
of the surgical team.</p>

After
the operation one may experience foreign body sensation, burning,
discomfort, tearing, photophobia, blurred vision and sometimes
headache. Vision may be blurred with reddish spots due to glare from
the light used during the operation. Stitches may have to be removed
after the operation.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Vision
will improve depending on the preoperative clinical situation. If
necessary, correction with temporary glasses may be prescribed after
a few days.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Professional
activity, the use of dangerous machines or instruments, and driving a
car are discouraged for a period to be determined by the
ophthalmologist.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Months
or years after surgery, opacification of the posterior capsule on
which the artificial lens rests may occur. This condition is called a
'secondary cataract', is not dependent on the surgical procedure and
causes vision to deteriorate again. The treatment consists of opening
the capsule using a special laser.</p>
<p>
Finally,
it is correct to note that cataract surgery increases the incidence
of retinal detachment.</p>

<strong>Adverse
    events</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
Although
perfectly standardised and, in the vast majority of cases, followed
by excellent results, cataract surgery does not escape the rule that
no medical act is risk-free. Therefore, it is not possible for the
ophthalmologist to guarantee the success of the operation or to
guarantee that no adverse events occur before, during and after
surgery.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
One
must think of cataract surgery as any drug treatment.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
drug package leaflet contains a list of foreseeable adverse events
(in pharmacology the term adverse reaction is used, but here, for
ease of understanding, the term adverse event is used) that may occur
after taking the product. None of the events mentioned in the package
leaflet can be prevented except by avoiding taking the drug. If,
however, the drug is necessary, the patient takes it assuming the
foreseeable (known) risks and also the unforeseeable (unknown) risks
for which the patient is asked to report to the treating physician.
Similarly, in cataract surgery there are numerous adverse events that
are foreseeable but cannot be prevented in any other way than by
avoiding undergoing the operation. The</p>

The
patient who signs the information and consent form for cataract
surgery necessarily assumes the risks foreseen for this surgical
procedure and also those not foreseen because they have never been
reported in the scientific literature. The cataract patient has three
options:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <p>
        refuse
        to undergo surgery in order not to incur any of the foreseeable
        risks and thereby lose visual function due to the development of
        cataracts</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        postpone
        cataract surgery knowing that this decision increases the
        possibility of incurring predictable but not preventable
        intraoperative and postoperative adverse events</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    <p>
        accepting
        cataract surgery by assuming the foreseeable but not preventable
        risks associated with the surgical treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
The
following are foreseeable but unpreventable adverse events that may
occur in preparation for cataract surgery, during cataract surgery
and after cataract surgery. In addition to the known manifestations
listed here, other unforeseeable and unpreventable local and systemic
manifestations are possible.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Preparation
    for cataract surgery</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
redness of the eye to be operated on due to hypersensitivity to the
drugs required to prepare the eye for surgery</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
If
the eye is anaesthetised with an injection, this can occur:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
eyelid, periocular, conjunctival haemorrhage: may persist for several
days after surgery</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
retrobulbar haemorrhage: can irreparably damage the optic nerve
resulting in loss of visual function</p>
<p>
-
permanent visual impairment from mechanical damage to the optic nerve</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
retinal detachment from perforation of the eyeball, requiring other
surgery in an attempt to repair it</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
double vision from damaged eye muscles</p>

<strong>During
    cataract surgery</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
deep intra-operative haemorrhage: this can be very serious and lead
to loss of vision or even anatomical loss of the eye</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
rupture of the posterior capsule: this is the most common cause of
functional failure. As a result of capsule rupture:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <p>
        complete
        extraction of the cataract may not be possible so that residues of
        the cataracted lens remain inside the eye; subsequent surgery may be
        necessary to remove them
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        it
        may not be possible to position the artificial lens in the natural
        position of the capsular bag, but it may be necessary to position it
        in a different location; under these conditions, the artificial lens
        may become decentred, requiring a subsequent operation to reposition
        it
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>
        it
        may not be possible to implant the artificial lens, which can be
        implanted at a later date by means of another surgical procedure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-
Caustication of the surgical wound: when cataract surgery is
particularly complex, high time and energy are required to remove the
cataract. The ultrasound probe heats up excessively and can burn the
surgical wound resulting in the need to suture the wound and
induction of postoperative astigmatism. Sometimes, despite suturing,
the surgical wound may not seal and require further surgery.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>After
    cataract surgery</strong>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
internal inflammatory reaction of the anterior portion of the eye of
a toxic nature in response to the various substances introduced into
the eye required to perform the procedure</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
internal eye infection: despite all the procedures for preparing the
surgical field and thoroughly disinfecting the eye, it is not
technically possible to sterilise the eye. Therefore, in some
individuals, an internal infectious phenomenon called endophthalmitis
can be triggered. In some cases the phenomenon is controllable with
medical therapy, in other cases it may require another demanding
operation (vitrectomy) and, in extreme cases, may</p>

removal
of the eyeball may be necessary. In almost all cases there is severe
loss of vision.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
macular oedema: this is an inflammatory response to surgery that can
cause significant temporary or permanent visual impairment</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
retinal detachment: this is an adverse event that occurs more
frequently in cataract-operated eyes than in non-operated eyes. The
reasons are uncertain, but the major risk factors are the patient's
young age, high myopia, eye trauma, more complex cataract surgery,
diabetes and male gender. Retinal detachment requires further surgery
and can cause permanent visual impairment. If symptoms such as the
vision of flying flies and flashes of light appear, an urgent eye
examination is necessary.</p>
<p>
-
reaction of the macula to operating microscope light and surgical
stress with reduced visual capacity</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
alteration of the corneal endothelium resulting in opacity of the
cornea: may require corneal transplantation in some cases</p>
<p>
-
refractive residual: the technology for calculating artificial lens
power does not allow a perfect calculation. The instrumental error of
the artificial lens calculation is more likely in subjects with other
eye diseases, high refractive defects (high myopia, high
hypermetropia, high astigmatism) and advanced cataract. In these
cases, if not correctable with glasses, subsequent surgery to replace
the implanted lens or refractive surgery to correct the residual
defect may be necessary</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>
-
perception of 'flying flies' due to pre-existing vitreous
abnormalities</p>
<p><br>

ptosis (drooping) of the upper eyelid</p>
